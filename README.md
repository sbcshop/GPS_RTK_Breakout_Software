# GPS RTK Breakout

The SB-Components GPS RTK Breakout is the next iteration of u-blox's GPS offerings! This version takes advantage of dead reckoning for navigation. The u-Blox ZED-F9R is a powerful GPS-RTK (Real Time Kinematic) unit that uses a fusion of IMU, wheel ticks, a vehicle dynamics model, correction data, and GNSS measurements to provide a highly accurate and continuous position for navigation under challenging conditions. We will quickly get you set up using the Qwiic ecosystem through Arduino and Python so that you can start reading the output!
