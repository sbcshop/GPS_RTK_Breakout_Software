# GPS RTK Breakout 

In less than 30 seconds, GPS RTK Breakout enables you to determine your position, direction, and travel route to any destination on Earth. So, the better the precision, the more! We had to include it on this board since GPS Real Time Kinematics (RTK) has perfected fine-tuning its GPS modules' accuracy to only millimetres!

The GPS-RTK HAT from SB Components enhanced high-precision GPS. The ZED-F9P module from u-Blox, which offers 10mm of 3-dimensional accuracy, is the newest one that it has. The X, Y, and Z coordinates that may be generated using these boards are roughly the width of your fingernail. That is what you just read. High precision GPS requires both a stream of correction data from an RTCM source and a powerful antenna.

## Hardware Overview

<img src = "https://github.com/sbcshop/GPS_RTK_Breakout_Software/blob/main/Images/img3.png"/>


#### Battery
A small lithium battery can be seen in the little metal disc immediately to the right of the ZED-F9R module, precisely like the breakout board. The key mechanisms inside the IC that enable a speedy reconnection to satellites are powered by this battery rather than the IC itself, as the 3.3V system does. When it has a lock, the battery will allow for a two-second time to first fix, however the time to first repair will be around 26 seconds. This is referred to as a "hot start," and it continues for four hours after the board is turned off. While the board is powered, the battery steadily charges and may run the backup system for more than a year. Let your module sit for a complete charge.

### SMA Connector
GPS Anteena connector

#### LEDâ€™s
Just like the breakout board, there are four LEDs on the bottom left of the board. Starting from the left:

* ***PWR:*** The power LED labeled as PWR will illuminate when 3.3V is activated.
* ***PPS:*** pulse-per-second led indicator. When receiving a basic GPS/GNSS location lock, the module starts flashing at 1Hz.
* ***RTK:*** A real-time kinematic led indicator. when the gadget is operating in standard GPS mode, it stays high. blinking starts when the module enters RTK float                mode after receiving RTCM adjustments. When the module switches to RTK fixed mode and starts to output locations with a precision of a cm, it drops.
* ***GF:*** TA led indication for a geofence. U-Center configuration. will change when a geofence is set up, going high or low. When the module leaves a preset                     boundary, it may be used to start alerts and do other actions.
#### USB
To connect the ZED-F9R to u-center software, you can attach a USB Type-C cable to the connector.

## Communication Protocol

* UART 
   * The ZED-F9P has traditional serial pins. The UART(RX/TX) pins are activated by default. Make that the UART/SPI jumper is open on top of the board. 
   * The ZED-F9P has a second serial port UART2(TX2/RX2) that is mostly utilised for RTCM3 correction data. This port's default behaviour is to automatically accept        and interpret incoming RTCM3 strings, enabling the board's RTK mode.
* I2C 
   *  By default, the I2C pins are enabled.
   
## Features
* Horizontal Position Accuracy:
     * 2.5m without RTK
     * 0.010m with RTK
* Enables simultaneous reception of four GNSS constellations (GPS, BeiDou, Galileo, and GLONASS) while being power efficient.
* Max Velocity: 500m/s 
* Max Altitude: 50km
* It receives both L1C/A and L2C bands
* 4 LEDs for displaying the module's status.
* Supports U-Center, a simple method of configuring the module.
* RTK has several bands, quick convergence times, centimeter-level precision, and a high update rate.
* Current: 68mA - 130mA (varies with constellations and tracking state)


## Steps to Setup With Raspberry pi

**Step.1 -** To start working with our GPS RTK Breakout with Rasberry pi/Rock pi, you to setup your pi board to boot by uploading lates OS of it.

**Step.2 -** After that, attach the GPS RTK Breakout on your Pi board and power it by providing suitable power supply. 

**Step.3 -** Once your Pi is booted, open command line and type the below command to clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/sbcshop/GPS_RTK_Breakout_Software.git
```

**Step.4 -** After downloading this repository in your Pi board, you can run any of examples provided in this repository. Make sure before running any example code, move it out of ***Examples folder*** and then open it to run.


## Using GPS RTK HAT Via USB:

For using this Breakout with USB cable you have to install the USB driver and a Software Application of ublox(U Center). For this you can visit the links below,

[**Download USB Driver**](https://deviceinbox.com/drivers/1870-u-blox-gnss-standard-usb-driver.html)

[**Download Software Application**](https://www.u-blox.com/en/product/u-center) and we have also provided it in this repository. After making these setup follow the steps below:

#### To learn how to use U Center application, click here.
[u-center User guide ](https://github.com/sbcshop/GPS_RTK_Breakout_Hardware/blob/main/u-center_Userguide.pdf)

**Step.1 -** After intalling the above mentioned software, plugin your GPS RTK HAT to your system via USB Type-C cable and check for the available COM port. As shon in below image
